# Crime_Time_Final_Project

## Communication Protocol (Week 1):
As we are still getting things figured out for our project, these requirements will probably be specific to week 1. Expect a more consistent schedule to be built later.

* Team will meet every Monday and Wednesday at normal class time.
* Team will determine before ending each Zoom session when all members are able to meet outside of class times via Zoom.

## Deliverable 1 Requirements:
### General Requirements
Team members have drafted their project, including the following:

- [X] Selected topic
- [ ] Reason why they selected their topic 
- [ ] Description of their source of data
- [X] Questions they hope to answer with the data

---

### GitHub Requirements:
Main Branch
- [X] Includes a README.md

README.md must include:
- [ ] Description of the communication protocols
- [X] At least one branch for each team member
- [ ] Each team member has at least four commits from the duration of the first segment

**Note**: The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted.

--- 

### Machine Learning Model Requirements:
- [ ] Takes in data in from the provisional database
- [ ] Outputs label(s) for input data

---

### Database Requirements:
- [ ] Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
- [ ] Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database

## Project Overview

The City of Chicago has a long history of crime. The overall crime rate is higher than that of the national average. In fact, the chance of becoming a victim of either a violent crime or property crime in Chicago is 1 in 28 [(Reference)](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/il/chicago/crime#description).  Unfortunately, many crimes reported do not result in an arrest. This project examines crime data reported in the city of Chicago from 2010 to present to determine if an arrest for a crime can be predicted based on location, time, and crime perpetrated.

## Reason

Several members of the team expressed an interested in researching in the broad area of crime. We discussed several options for locations and eventually settled on Chicago. When looking at the data file, we observed that there are many crimes reported that result in no arrests. Thus, we decided to try to build a machine learning model that can be used to predict arrest rate based on location, time, and/or type of crime committed.

## Data Source and Preprocessing

The data for this project was retrieved from Data.gov and was published by The City of Chicago. There were # crimes reported and includes information about X. Data were filtered or dropped during the preprocessing with Pandas using the following criteria:

1. Data were filtered by date to include years 2015 and forward.
2. Rows including NaNs and empty cells were deleted.
3.
4.
