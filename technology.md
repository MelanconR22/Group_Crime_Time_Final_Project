# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas has been used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
We plan to use AWS to store the dataset and connect with pgadmin from there to further transform the data for visualization.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. We are using the RandomForestClassifier model. 

## Dashboard
Our group plans to work with Tableauto create a fully functioning and interactive dashboard.
