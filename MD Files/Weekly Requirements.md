- [X] Presentations are drafted in Google Slides.

## GitHub:
**Main Branch
All code in the main branch is production-ready.
The main branch should include:
- [X] All code necessary to perform exploratory analysis
- [X] Some code necessary to complete the machine learning portion of the project


**README.md
README.md must include:
- [X] Description of the communication protocols
- [X] Outline of the project (this may include images, but should be easy to follow and digest)
Note: The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted.
Individual Branches
- [X] At least one branch for each team member 
- [X] Each team member has at least four commits for the duration of the second segment (eight total commits per person)

## Machine Learning Model:
Team members submit the code for their machine learning model, as well as the following:
- [X] Description of preliminary data preprocessing 
- [X] Description of preliminary feature engineering and preliminary feature selection, including their decision-making process
- [X] Description of how data was split into training and testing sets
- [X] Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits

## Database:
Team members present a fully integrated database.
- [X] Database stores static data for use during the project
- [X] Database interfaces with the project in some format (e.g., scraping updates the database, or database connects to the model)
- [X] Includes at least two tables (or collections, if using MongoDB)
- [X] Includes at least one join using the database language (not including any joins in Pandas)
- [X] Includes at least one connection string (using SQLAlchemy or PyMongo)
Note: If you use a SQL database, you must provide your ERD with relationships.

## Dashboard:
A blueprint for the dashboard is created and includes all of the following:
